## Description

My code and process for building my own personal website.

## Motivation

I like to do a lot of things in life, but felt I had no good way to show them off. Sure I can put all my photos in Instagram or Flickr, and I can have my work experience on LinkedIn, but there was no quick solution to put everything I do in one spot. Also I was bored one day and thought this would be fun to do (that's probably the bigger reason). Hopefully this website makes it easier to those interested in knowing more about me to find whatever info they are looking for.

## Installation and Setup

1. Used Github to set up my own static website
2. Found a template from the internet that I could modify (Browny from free-css.com)
3. Heavily modified it to match what I needed
   a) Used a lot of ChatGPT to fill in the holes of what I needed. For example, the skill section and hobbies section were based in GPT code that was modified to actually work.
4. Uploaded some major past projects to GitHub and attached through links in the website.

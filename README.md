## Description

My code and process for building my own personal website.

## Installation and Setup

1. Used Github to set up my own static website
2. Found a template from the internet that I could modify (Browny from free-css.com)
3. Heavily modified it to match what I needed
4. Uploaded some major past projects to GitHub and attached through links in the website.
